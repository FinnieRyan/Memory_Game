# Mind Me

## Description:
Mind Me is a memory testing game with four themes to choose from and four difficulty levels. Each difficulty level is assigned a set number of cards with a maximum of 12 cards. The player will have a set number of moves to complete the game. Each card has an image underneath which the player has to find its match. Every time a game starts all the cards are shuffled, making every game unique. The user has a set number of attempts in a game to match a turned card to its pair. If unsuccessful the cards turn back over and the player can try again.

## Requirements:
* The user should be able to click and choose a theme from the theme menu;
* The user should be able to choose a difficulty;
* There should be at least one API theme to choose from;
* The game should display the rows and columns of cards after the user has set a difficulty level;
* The use should be able to change the theme or restart at any given point;
* The user should be able to see the number of turns left on the screen depending on difficulty;
* The game should have logic to allow the cards to flip and match;
* The game should have a win/lose scenario/condition;

## Extensions:
* There should be a time limit displayed on the screen depending on the difficulty level. 



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
